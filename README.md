# Adam Ba≈Ñka - Portfolio Projects

Hi, I'm Adam. I got interested in data engineering and analytics, and this is my portfolio of projects in these fields. As of now, there are two completed ones, with more in development.

**Currently engaged in:** Spark and Databricks course - aiming to gain insights into data processing in Azure.

# Projects

## Divvy App User Insights

**Goal:** Finding differences in the behavior of two types of users.

**Code:** [`Divvy App Data part 1 - Description and SQL Preprocessing.pdf`](https://github.com/AdamBanka/Data-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Divvy_App_Files/Divvy_App_Data_part_1-Description_and_SQL_Preprocessing.pdf)    
[`Divvy App Data part 2 - Data Visualization and ML models.ipynb`](https://github.com/AdamBanka/Data-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Divvy_App_Files/Divvy_App_Data_part_2-Visualization_and_ML_models.ipynb)

**Description:** Engaging with a dataset of 5.6 million rides from Divvy, a bikesharing app, throughout 2022, the project involves data loading, preprocessing, and exploration. It aims to uncover distinctions in user behavior between casual and member types through data analysis and visualization. Additionally, it delves into basic machine learning models for imputing missing values.

**Skills:** Data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning.

**Technology:** Python, SQL, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, scikit-learn.

**Results:** Highlighting distinctions in behavior between the casual and member user types.

## AdventureWorks Dataset Visualization

*Note: This project was done while following [`this course`](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/).*

**Goal:** Uncovering key patterns and insights within the dataset.

**Link to the project:** [`AdventureWorks Report`](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOTkyYTU1OTctNDVhMS00YTBmLWEzZjUtMWUyNzBiOTc2MGU4IiwidCI6ImJjNWMwMTRkLTA0NTAtNDcyNC1hNTkzLTg5ODQyNjcwZGJmZCJ9&pageName=ReportSection&language=en&formatLocale=en-US) 

.pbix version: [`AdventureWorks Report.pbix`](https://github.com/AdamBanka/Data-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/AdventureWorks_Report.pbix)

**Description:** This project focuses on visualizing the AdventureWorks dataset, which is a popular dataset of a fictitious bike shop company. It incorporates dimensions such as product sales, returns, product details, and customer information. Three PowerBI dashboards and a map offer insights into business metrics, sales patterns, and customer overviews.

**Skills:** Data preprocessing, data analysis, DAX formulas, data visualization, interactive dashboards.

**Technology:** Power BI, DAX.

**Results:** The project unveils sales data and patterns through interactive dashboards. Business metrics and insights into products and customers are communicated.
